       :doc "This is a socket layer over the REPL in clojure.main.  This can
       be run from a java startup using the launcher class or by calling -main
       using clojure script or within a clojure application.  There is support
       for providing a socket based ack to a process that started the repl-server.
       Startup:
       (-main \"A string name for the REPL\" server-port ack-port)
       The server port can be 0 which will cause the server to use the next available
       socket port.
       Acknowledgment port
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       In cases where you want to be able to be nofified when the repl-server
       has successfully been started up and/or you want to use the next available
       port and need to be notified of what that port was, the Enclojure repl-server
       uses and ack-port to create a repl-client to talk back to the starting process.
       For an example of this see:
       org.enclojure.ide.repl.repl-manager/get-ack-port
       If the ack-port is not provided no acknowledgment will be attempted.
       If the ack-port is provided a repl-client connection will be made and
       will send a function call to:
       (repl-ack repl-id server-port)
       There is a function:
       (set-repl-ack-fn ack-fn)
       where you can set the function to be called in your client application.
