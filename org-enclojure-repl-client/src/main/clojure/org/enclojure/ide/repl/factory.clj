       :doc "This file defines the startup routines for the 3 types of repls:
            1. Inproc - Runs inside the current application.
            2. External unmanaged - There is a running repl server in a remote
                application that will be connected to via a socket.
            3. External managed - A child process will be started and conneted to
                via socket.  When the parent process ends so will any children
                started (hence, managed).

           The validation routines for the config data for each case defined above
           are in the org.enclojure.ide.repl.repl-data ns and are:
           -repl-context-validation-
           -repl-context-external-validation-
           -repl-context-external-managed-validation-
           respectively.  These maps are used by the org.enclojure.commons.validation
           routines to ensure the proper configiuration data is passed prior to
           attempting to create a REPL.
           You will also have to implement the org.enclojure.repl.IReplWindowFactory
           for creating parent windows for the REPLs.  This enables this framework
           to be pluggable into another windowing framework such as Netbeans."}
